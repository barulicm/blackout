# blackout
Utility for blacking out a portion of your screen on Windows.

When running some FLL events, we often have to project on just half of the projector screen without reconfiguring the projector at the venue.

This little tool puts a plain black, draggable, resizable, and always-on-top rectangle on the screen. 

To remove the rectangle right click the app's icon in the taskbar and select "Close window".
